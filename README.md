## Overview:

### Project1: Predicting houses â€˜prices

In this project, I applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and utilized a logistic regression model to predict housing prices based on various features.


### Project2: Predicting Renewable energy consumption

In this project, I analyzed energy consumption patterns and developed forecasts for future usage using ARIMA and SARIMA models.


### Project3: Fuel Efficiency Prediction

n this analysis, I applied linear regression to predict vehicle fuel efficiency, measured in miles per gallon, while elucidating the impact of various features on this outcome.


### Project4: Sales Time Series Modeling

In this analysis, I systematically prepared the dataset and conducted a comparative evaluation of the Holt-Winters and SARIMAX models for sales forecasting.


### Project5: Customers Segmentation

This project presents an excellent opportunity to demonstrate my ability to apply the K-Means clustering model to effectively segment a retail company's customers into meaningful and actionable groups.


### Project6: Movie reviews Sentiment Analysis

In this project, I utilized the TextBlob library to perform sentiment classification on movie reviews and evaluated its performance in comparison to random guessing.


### Project7: Healthcare fraud detection

In this analysis, I performed comprehensive data cleaning, exploration and preprocessing, followed by the development of a logistic regression model to identify fraudulent claims within Medicare and Medicaid organizations.


### Project8: Coin Market Automating API

In this project, I implemented an automated process to extract cryptocurrency market data using an API.
